# Non-alcoholic-beer
A repository for some of the work I'm doing for my capstone practicum of my graduate school. Currently, I am working on a project to make data-driven perceptual map. To collect the data, I scraped reviews and ratings from a beer forum called Beer Advocate.

I used R and Python for the scraping work. Some packages I used are listed below

* R: \{Tidyverse\}, \{rvest\}, \{reticulate\}, \{factoextra\}
* Python: Requests, BeautifulSoup4

The entire project so far has allowed me to work on my web scraping, data manipulation, and principal component analysis skills.
